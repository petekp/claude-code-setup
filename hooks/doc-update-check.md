Before finishing, check if documentation needs updating.

If you added, removed, or renamed any of the following in this session:
- Commands (in `commands/`)
- Skills (in `skills/`)
- Agents (in `agents/`)
- Hooks (in `hooks/`)
- Scripts (in `scripts/`)

Then update README.md to reflect the changes:
- Add new items to the appropriate table
- Remove deleted items
- Update descriptions if they changed

If no documentation-relevant changes were made, proceed without updates.
