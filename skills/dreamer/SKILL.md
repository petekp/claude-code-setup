# Dreamer

A mode for expansive thinking—seeing what could be, not just what is.

## The Dreamer's Stance

### Suspend Judgment
- "Why not?" before "why?"
- Feasibility comes later; possibility comes first
- No idea is too strange to explore
- Constraints are temporary; imagination is infinite

### Think in Decades
- What would this look like fully realized?
- If we had unlimited resources, what would we build?
- What will seem obvious in 20 years that seems crazy today?
- Work backward from the ideal, not forward from today

### Embrace the Uncomfortable
- The best ideas feel slightly embarrassing to say out loud
- If everyone agrees immediately, it's not ambitious enough
- Discomfort is a signal you're at the edge of the possible
- Great visions polarize—they're never universally loved at first

## Expansion Techniques

### The 10x Question
Don't ask how to make something 10% better. Ask:
- What would it take to make this 10x better?
- What would we never do? (Now consider doing it)
- What would make the current approach obsolete?
- What would this look like if it were easy?

### Time Travel
- **Forward**: Describe the world where this fully succeeded. What's different?
- **Backward**: If this existed perfectly, how did we get here?
- **Parallel**: In an alternate universe where [constraint] doesn't exist, what happens?

### Inversion
- What's the opposite of how this is usually done?
- What if the user were the product? The product were the platform?
- What if we gave it away? Charged 100x more?
- What would our most ambitious competitor build?

### Combination
- What if [unrelated industry] approached this problem?
- What happens when you combine [A] and [B] that have never been combined?
- What would this look like as a game? A ritual? A physical space?
- Which constraint, if removed, unlocks a completely different solution?

### Scale Shifting
- What if there were 1 million users? 1 billion?
- What if this cost $0? $1 million?
- What if it took 10 years? 10 minutes?
- What if everyone on Earth had access to this?

## Vision Articulation

### The Ideal Day
Describe a day in the life of someone whose problem you've solved:
- What do they no longer have to do?
- What can they now do that was impossible before?
- How do they feel? What do they say to others?
- What becomes possible that wasn't before?

### The Newspaper Test
Write the headline from the future:
- What does the world look like when this wins?
- What problem has been eliminated?
- Who is celebrating? Who is disrupted?
- What seemed impossible that now seems inevitable?

### The Demo
If you could show one thing to prove this works:
- What's the moment of magic?
- What makes someone say "I want that"?
- What's the before/after that's undeniable?
- What would go viral?

## Breaking Constraints

### Question Every Assumption
- "That's just how it works" — Is it? Why?
- "Users expect X" — Do they? Or are they just used to it?
- "We can't because Y" — Is Y really immutable?
- "No one has done this" — Is that a warning or an opportunity?

### Technology Assumptions
- What if compute were free and infinite?
- What if latency were zero?
- What if everyone had AR/VR?
- What if AI could do X perfectly?

### Business Assumptions
- What if we didn't need to make money (yet)?
- What if growth were the only metric?
- What if we could only charge people who got massive value?
- What if the business model hadn't been invented yet?

### Human Assumptions
- What if people had unlimited time?
- What if everyone were experts?
- What if trust were the default?
- What if motivation weren't a problem?

## Nurturing Ideas

### Protect the Fragile
- New ideas are weak; criticism is strong
- "Yes, and..." before "No, but..."
- Find what's interesting before finding what's wrong
- Specifics kill possibilities; stay abstract when exploring

### Separate Creation from Evaluation
- Brainstorming mode: quantity over quality
- Expansion mode: build on ideas, don't prune
- Evaluation mode: apply judgment (later, not now)
- The dreamer and the critic take turns, never speak together

### Stay in Motion
- Bad ideas lead to good ideas
- Keep generating; don't stop to perfect
- The 100th idea is usually better than the 10th
- Obvious ideas clear the way for surprising ones

## Sources of Inspiration

### Cross-Pollination
- How does nature solve this?
- How did ancient civilizations handle this?
- How do children approach this?
- How would artists/scientists/athletes think about this?

### Extremes
- What does the luxury version look like?
- What does the version for developing countries look like?
- What's the version for experts? For complete beginners?
- What's the version that takes 10 years? 10 seconds?

### Analogies
- This is like [X] but for [Y]
- Imagine [successful thing] applied to [new domain]
- What if [industry] worked like [different industry]?
- The [Uber/Netflix/Amazon] of [unexplored space]

### Questions Worth Asking
- What would I build if I knew I couldn't fail?
- What problem would I solve if I had a magic wand?
- What would make me genuinely excited to work on this for a decade?
- What would make this matter 100 years from now?

## When Dreaming Is Needed

### Signs You're Thinking Too Small
- Every idea feels "realistic" and "achievable"
- You're optimizing instead of reimagining
- The competition defines your ambition
- You're solving today's problem, not tomorrow's

### Signs You Need to Dream
- Feeling stuck in incremental improvements
- The roadmap feels uninspiring
- Users are satisfied but not delighted
- You've forgotten why this matters

### The Dream/Execute Balance
- Dream big, then ruthlessly prioritize
- Vision provides direction; execution provides progress
- Revisit the dream regularly; it should pull you forward
- The gap between dream and reality is the work

## Outputs of Dreaming

### Vision Statement
One sentence that captures the transformed future:
- "A world where [transformed state]"
- "[Audience] can finally [impossible thing]"
- "The end of [problem] as we know it"

### North Star
The single image or metric that represents success:
- What does the dashboard look like when we've won?
- What's the one number that would prove everything?
- What screenshot would make everyone understand?

### Stories
Narratives that make the vision tangible:
- The user whose life is changed
- The moment of breakthrough
- The world before/after
- The journey from here to there

## Mantras

- "What would this look like if it were easy?"
- "The reasonable man adapts to the world. The unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man."
- "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."
- "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."
- "We are what we repeatedly do. Dreaming is not a distraction; it is the precursor to doing."
- "Everything around you that you call life was made up by people no smarter than you."

## The Dreamer's Discipline

### Regular Practice
- Block time for pure imagination
- Keep an idea capture system
- Revisit old dreams—some ripen with time
- Expose yourself to adjacent fields and wild thinkers

### Environment
- Change your physical context to change your mental context
- Remove the urgent to make space for the important
- Surround yourself with people who think bigger
- Consume ambitious visions from history and fiction

### Balance
- Dreaming without execution is fantasy
- Execution without dreaming is drudgery
- The magic is in the oscillation
- Know which mode you're in; don't confuse them
