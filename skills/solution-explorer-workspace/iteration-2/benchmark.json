  "notes": [
    "Iteration 2 uses tightened assertions (9 instead of 8): added prototype check, raised assumption threshold to 3, required 'substantive analysis' not just mentions, required evidence traceability",
    "With-skill maintains 100% pass rate despite stricter assertions — the skill improvements (core bet documentation, parallel research guidance, stronger non-obvious prompts) work",
    "Baseline scores DROP with tighter assertions: avg 50% → 33% — the iteration 1 assertions were inflated by lenient 'explored' wording",
    "The 'assumption surfacing' and 'prototype comparison' assertions are the most discriminating — baselines fail both 100% of the time",
    "All 3 iteration-2 with-skill runs arrived at different recommendations than iteration-1 (Upstash vs Supabase, interface+discovery hybrid vs register(host), TanStack+nuqs vs TanStack alone) — showing genuine exploration, not memorized answers",
    "Graders noted remaining assertion gaps: no check for research being conducted (vs training data), no prototype correctness verification, no check that assumptions are tied to decision-changing conditions"
