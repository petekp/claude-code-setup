# Recover from Session Impasse

You've hit a wall—whether it's a rabbit hole, a tangled mess of competing changes, or a session that's lost its way. The good news: we can reset with clarity.

Let me help you escape by:

1. **Assessing the situation** - Understanding what's actually on the table right now (code state, conversation state, dead ends)
2. **Clarifying the real goal** - Distinguishing between the original objective and what we've drifted toward
3. **Choosing a recovery path** - Concrete options (salvage parts, restart clean, pivot approach, etc.)
4. **Moving forward** - Executing the chosen path with added knowledge of what to avoid

## Context

Let me start by asking: **What was the original goal when we started down this path?** And what specifically made you feel like we hit an impasse?

Once I understand that, I'll assess:
- Current state of the code/files
- Whether parts of what we've done are salvageable
- What the simplest path forward actually is

Then we'll pick a direction and move forward with the benefit of knowing what didn't work.
