Refactor $ARGUMENTS to improve:

1. **Readability**
   - Clear variable/function names
   - Reduce complexity
   - Extract helper functions
   - Add helpful comments

2. **Maintainability**
   - DRY principle
   - Single responsibility
   - Loose coupling
   - High cohesion

3. **Type Safety**
   - Replace `any` with proper types
   - Add generics where helpful
   - Improve type inference

4. **Modern Patterns**
   - Use modern React patterns
   - Leverage TypeScript features
   - Apply functional programming where appropriate

IMPORTANT: Maintain exact same functionality and API - this is refactoring, not rewriting.
